DineIQ Analytics - RFM Customer Value Feature Engineering (SRS Step 7)
Computes the exact RFM and monetary features specified in SRS:
 1. customer_recency: Days elapsed since customer's most recent completed order
 2. customer_frequency: Lifetime count of orders placed by customer
 3. customer_monetary_value: Lifetime cumulative spend ($) of customer
 4. average_order_value (AOV): Mean spend per transaction (Monetary / Frequency)
 5. rfm_score: Composite RFM tier score (e.g., Champions, Loyal, At-Risk, Hibernating)

Generate Ratings Table (100,000 records)
Per SRS Section 2 & Hint specifications.
Injects:
- 100,000 rating records linked to orders, customers, items, and locations
- Rating anomalies per SRS hint:
  * Rating sentiment mismatch (e.g., 1-star rating with enthusiastic positive text, or 5-star rating with scathing complaint)
  * Duplicate bot / spam review clusters
  * Severe rating dips correlated with misleading promotion orders
  * Rating variations across restaurant locations (Flagship vs Express)

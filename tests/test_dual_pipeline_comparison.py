DineIQ Analytics - Dual Pipeline Comparison Tests (SRS Step 14)
Verifies:
- Dual pipeline comparison report exists at reports/model_comparison/dual_pipeline_comparison_report.md
- Covers AT LEAST 100 records (Deliverable #7)
- Contains EXACTLY the 8 required fields:
  1. Record ID
  2. Actual class or value
  3. Spark result
  4. Python result
  5. Match or mismatch
  6. Numerical difference (wherever applicable)
  7. Explanation of disagreement
  8. Overall agreement percentage
- Agreement percentage is calculated and falls within valid range

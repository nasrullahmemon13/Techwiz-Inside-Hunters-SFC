"""
Unit and Integration Tests for DineIQ Promotion Effectiveness & Trap Detection (SRS Steps 27-28)
Validates:
- Step 27: Multi-dimensional promotion evaluation across all 8 dimensions:
  * order volume, revenue, contribution margin, customer acquisition, repeat purchases, AOV, wastage, post-promo behavior
  * enforcement of SRS explicit rule: 'An increase in sales alone must not automatically classify a promotion as successful.'
- Step 28: Promotion Trap Detection identifying EXACTLY the 5 SRS-listed misleading patterns:
  1. sales increase but profit decreases
  2. customer count increases but average margin collapses
  3. promotion increases wastage
  4. customers purchase only while discounts are active
  5. promotion shifts sales away from a more profitable product
